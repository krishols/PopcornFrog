# Popcorn Frog
You're a frog stuck in a popcorn machine! Use your tongue to catch the popcorn and avoid the candy and movie theater 
workers!

## About
Control a frog that leaps around the inside of the popcorn machine and eat popcorn that falls from the top. When the frog
eats enough popcorn it will advance to the next level. If you let enough popcorn kernels fall of screen the game will end!
ake sure to avoid the candy falling from the top of the machine because it will make you lose progress towards the next level.
Take on the special boss rounds and dodge the movie theater worker's hand as they try to grab you out of the machine. 
Jump onto platforms and away from rising popcorn or you'll lose the game!
